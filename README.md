# Signal-Processing-Toolkit
(Written in Matlab)  Signal Processing toolkit written for analysis of analog signals in both the frequency and time domain.


This toolkit was written to perform a number of different analyses on analog signals (specifically Local Field Potentials but can be used for others with a few changes) in frequency and time domains.

It can analyze power, correlation, spike-triggered averages, spike-lfp coherence, lfp-lfp coherence, and more.

It also has analyses based on multi-taper methods as well as wavelets.
